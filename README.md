# SensorServer
Server is used to record sensor data from the MQTT topic
## Difference?
This is a C/C++ Implementation of the previous server software. Why?
I simply want to cut down the cost on memory so there's that.

### Cost Table


Lang | Baseline | NodeJS | C/C++
--- | --- | --- | ---
Memory Usage | 1GB | 45-80 MB | ???
Cost | $5/mo | $0.225-$0.4/mo | ????
